    <h2>Meet the Artist</h2>
    <p>
        From a Young age, I loved creating art. In high school, I tried to get as involved as I could with the art community. Since sophomore year I was involved in the honors art program and was featured in my own show at the local library. I also had two art internships, one at a nationally known lighting store, Janna Ugone and Co, and another at a local children’s art and bookshop, Art Always. For friends and family’s birthdays, I always painted the present or made the card.

    <h2>The Start</h2>
    <p>
        The story of how I started painting shoes is one of my favorites to tell. One of my closest friends’ moms reached out to me one day with a proposal. Her daughter wanted painted air forces for her birthday but on Etsy they were so expensive, and the mom insisted I would do a better job anyways. I helped her pick out the shoes and soon enough they were delivered to my house. I watched a video or two and looked up the best way to prep the surface but besides that I dived right in on my own. I treated the shoe like a normal canvas and then sealed them with the waterproof shoe spray because it was what I had laying around. Long story short, she still wears them to this day and that pair of shoes started my mini business.

        Now, many people have asked me to paint their shoes. I have done many designs from butterflies to dragons to landscape scenes. I love seeing what the owner of the shoe’s ideas are and helping them plan out what is on the shoe. I mainly painted shoes during my senior year of high school when covid hit. Sometimes over summer and winter breaks from college I will paint a pair or two of shoes but recently I have not had the time.
