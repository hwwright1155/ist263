           <h2>Meet the Artist</h2>
            <p>
                From a Young age, I loved creating art. In high school, I tried to get as involved as I could with the art community. Since sophomore year I was involved in the honors art program and was featured in my own show at the local library. I also had two art internships, one at a nationally known lighting store, Janna Ugone and Co, and another at a local children’s art and bookshop, Art Always. For friends and family’s birthdays, I always painted the present or made the card.

                I currently am a sophmore at Syracuse University. I am majoring in Information Management and Technology with a minor in Design Studies. I plan on having my major concentrations be Web Design and Digital Retail Management. I am a member of Kappa Alpaha Theta and Kappa Theta Pi, the proffesional technology fraternity. In my free time at school I like to spend my free time hanging out with friends, exploring the area around Syracuse, and shopping.

          <h2>The Start</h2>
           <p>
            The story of how I started painting shoes is one of my favorites to tell. One of my closest friends’ moms reached out to me one day with a proposal. Her daughter wanted painted air forces for her birthday but on Etsy they were so expensive, and the mom insisted I would do a better job anyways. I helped her pick out the shoes and soon enough they were delivered to my house. I watched a video or two and looked up the best way to prep the surface but besides that I dived right in on my own. I treated the shoe like a normal canvas and then sealed them with the waterproof shoe spray because it was what I had laying around. Long story short, she still wears them to this day and that pair of shoes started my mini business.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, many people have asked me to paint their shoes. I have done many designs from butterflies to dragons to landscape scenes. I love seeing what the owner of the shoe’s ideas are and helping them plan out what is on the shoe. I mainly painted shoes during my senior year of high school when covid hit. Sometimes over summer and winter breaks from college I will paint a pair or two of shoes but recently I have not had the time.
